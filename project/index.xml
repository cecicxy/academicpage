This involved studying various components such as the external system, data integration, database management, platform back-end, and platform front-end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the key aspects I focused on was the external system, which refers to the integration of the smart energy system with external devices or systems. This could include sensors, meters, or other IoT devices that collect data related to energy consumption, such as cooling, heating, and electricity usage. Understanding how these external systems interact with the smart energy system was crucial for developing effective energy management strategies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data integration played a vital role in the construction of smart energy systems. It involved aggregating and consolidating data from different sources, including the external devices mentioned earlier. This process required developing protocols and interfaces to ensure seamless communication between the various components of the system. By integrating data effectively, it became possible to gain a comprehensive view of energy consumption patterns and identify potential areas for optimization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managing the vast amount of data generated by smart energy systems required a robust database infrastructure. I studied the design and implementation of databases capable of handling high volumes of data efficiently. This involved selecting appropriate database technologies, optimizing data storage and retrieval processes, and ensuring data integrity and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The platform back-end formed the core of the smart energy system, responsible for processing and analyzing the collected data. I delved into techniques such as data preprocessing, work condition analysis, and correlation analysis to derive valuable insights from the energy consumption data. Load prediction was another important aspect I explored, as it allowed for better resource planning and optimization of energy usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The platform front-end served as the user interface for interacting with the smart energy system. This involved creating visualizations and dashboards that presented energy consumption data in a clear and understandable manner. By providing users with real-time information and control options, the front-end interface empowered them to make informed decisions regarding energy usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my investigation into the IoT construction of smart energy systems encompassed various aspects, including the external system, data integration, database management, platform back-end, and platform front-end. By understanding the intricacies of each component, I gained insights into how these systems operate and contribute to efficient energy management. This knowledge is crucial for developing sustainable and intelligent solutions to address the challenges of energy consumption in today&amp;rsquo;s world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Policy recommendation system</title><link>https://cecicxy.github.io/academicpage/project/policyrecommend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cecicxy.github.io/academicpage/project/policyrecommend/</guid><description>&lt;p>The system uses enterprise users&amp;rsquo; basic information, including location, sector, business scope, revenue, and past search records, to provide timely and accurate recommendations for relevant policies.

This allows for efficient utilization of the generated power, ensuring that surplus energy is not wasted and deficits are adequately supplemented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the core of this control system are the mathematical models of the PV array, wind turbine, and battery. These models enable the microgrid to accurately predict and optimize the power generation and storage capabilities of each component. By understanding the behavior and characteristics of these devices, the microgrid can make informed decisions about power distribution and utilization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, the microgrid employs various systematic control methods to maintain stability and maximize energy efficiency. One commonly used control technique is the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, which continuously adjusts the power flow based on the difference between the desired and actual power output. This helps regulate the power exchange between the grid, battery, and PV-wind power system, ensuring that energy is neither wasted nor insufficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important control method used in microgrids is Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). MPPT algorithms are employed to optimize the power output of the PV array and wind turbine by tracking and maintaining the devices at their maximum power points. By dynamically adjusting the operating conditions, such as voltage or current, the microgrid can extract the maximum available power from the renewable energy sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adaptive control is yet another systematic approach used in microgrids. This control method enables the microgrid to adapt its operation based on changing conditions, such as fluctuations in power generation or load demand. By continuously monitoring and analyzing the system&amp;rsquo;s performance, the microgrid can adjust its control parameters in real-time, ensuring efficient and reliable operation under varying circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the combination of these control methods empowers the microgrid to effectively manage power generation, storage, and distribution. It ensures that excess energy produced by the PV-wind power system is efficiently utilized by either supplying the grid or charging the battery. Conversely, in times of increased demand or reduced power generation, the microgrid can draw power from the battery or the grid to meet local load requirements. This dynamic control strategy enables the microgrid to achieve optimal energy balance, reducing reliance on the main grid and enhancing the overall sustainability and resilience of the power system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, the microgrid&amp;rsquo;s three levels of control, encompassing mathematical models and systematic control methods like PID control, MPPT, and adaptive control, play a vital role in managing power flow and optimizing the utilization of renewable energy sources. Through these control techniques, the microgrid ensures efficient and reliable operation, enhancing the sustainability and resilience of the power system.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
